# Muncoordinated
Muncoordinated is a Model UN committee management service, (re)written using TypeScript, React, Semantic UI and Firebase. Hacked out (in anger) two weeks prior to SydMUN 2017.

It seeks to replace the preexisting Windows-only desktop application, [Munrun](https://github.com/mjwest/munrun).
