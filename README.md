# Muncoordinated
Muncoordinated is an open-source Model UN committee management service, written using TypeScript, React, Semantic UI and Firebase. Hacked out (in anger) two weeks prior to SydMUN 2017.

It seeks to replace the preexisting Windows-only desktop application, [Munrun](https://github.com/mjwest/munrun).
